# Disc-Math & Other C++ Projects

Welcome to the Discrete Mathematics C++ Project repository! This project explores various concepts in discrete mathematics implemented in C++. 
It covers topics such as sets, relations, functions, combinatorics, graph theory, and more. The goal of this project is to provide a practical 
demonstration of these theoretical concepts through interactive and functional C++ code.
